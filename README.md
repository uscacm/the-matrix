> _This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the **blue pill** - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the **red pill** - you stay in Wonderland, and I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes. Remember, all I'm offering is the truth - nothing more._
